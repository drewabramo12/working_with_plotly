# working_with_plotly

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to build out the functions to visualize different aspects of bacterial cultures for each subject collected. This involved bacterial sample ID numbers, sample values, bacterial names and wash frequency respectively. These results were then visualized in a bar, gauge, and bubble graph to show diversity of bacterial types and their concentrations for each subject.

## Results

The functions created worked with existing code to save any changes from a drop down menu of subject ID numbers and to use them and the created functions to build multiple graphs.

## Summary

This project allowed for the visualization of multiple different graphs with one action.
